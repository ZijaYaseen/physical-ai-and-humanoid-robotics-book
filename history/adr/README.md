## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions made during the development of this project. Each ADR explains:
- The context and problem being addressed
- The decision that was made
- Alternative options that were considered
- The consequences of the decision
- References to related documents

This helps maintain a clear history of architectural evolution and enables informed decision-making as the project grows.
