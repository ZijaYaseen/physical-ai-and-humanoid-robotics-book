# Module 1 - Part 1: Core Architecture

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental architecture of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and actions.

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are the fundamental unit of execution in ROS. They are processes that perform computation.

### Topics and Messages
Topics are used for one-way communication between nodes. Messages are the data packets sent over topics.

### Services
Services provide a request/reply communication pattern.

### Actions
Actions are used for long-running tasks that have specific characteristics.

## Detailed Architecture

### Communication Patterns
- Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
- Client-Service Pattern
- Action Pattern

### Quality of Service (QoS)
- Reliability policies
- Durability policies
- History policies
