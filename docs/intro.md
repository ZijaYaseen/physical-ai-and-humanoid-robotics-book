# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book. This comprehensive resource covers essential concepts in robotics, artificial intelligence, and physical interaction.

## Course Overview

This course is structured around four core modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2** - Robot Operating System fundamentals
2. **Module 2: Simulation** - Simulation environments and tools
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - NVIDIA's robotics platform
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action** - Advanced AI models for robotics

Each module includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Learning Path

We recommend following the modules in sequence, as each builds upon the previous one. However, if you have prior experience with some topics, you may navigate directly to the modules most relevant to your interests.

## Interactive Learning

Throughout this course, you'll find interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow you to experiment with the concepts in real-time. These notebooks are designed to work both with and without specialized hardware, using simulation fallbacks where needed.

## Hardware & Cloud Options

This course accommodates both users with access to specialized hardware (RTX workstations, Jetson platforms) and those using cloud-based solutions. For more information on setup options, see our [Hardware & Cloud Guide](./hardware-cloud-options.md).
